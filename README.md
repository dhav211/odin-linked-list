# The Odin Project - Linked List

Continuing forward with The Odin Project, I find myself on the linked list challenge. Having spent a brief amount of time with linked lists in the past I decided to make a doubly linked list, and then a stack and a queue because those two seem more or less linked in my mind, being linear data structures and all. Also to up the ante just a little bit I did a few of the exercises from the book "Essential Algorithms" by Rod Stephans, which I thumb through occasionally with my morning coffee but haven't done much of the exercises.

Another note, I actually took them time and added JSDoc documentation. In my previous javascript projects this was lacking for whatever reason, so here they are, although at times it seems rather redundant.
